I chose the Quicksort algorithm due to its time complexity.
The challenge assumes two possible inputs that are, user input and file input. My reasoning was that the file could be large in size and
I decided that the Quicksort algorithm will be an appropriate choice. It can produce results fast and efficiently.

I wrote the program in Python as it is the language I am the most comfortable with.
